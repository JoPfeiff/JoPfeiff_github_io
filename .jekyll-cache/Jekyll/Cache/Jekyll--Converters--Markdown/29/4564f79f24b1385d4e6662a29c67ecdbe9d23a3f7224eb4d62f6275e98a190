I"-<p>I am a 3rd year PhD student working on Natural Language Processing.</p>

<p>I am interested in modular transfer learning where I currently find <a href="https://AdapterHub.ml">Adapters</a> quite cool to work with. 
My focus is on multilingual and multimodal transfer, where I am especially interested in very low resource languages.</p>

<p>I am one of the main contributors of the <a href="https://AdapterHub.ml">AdapterHub.ml</a> framework, which makes it very easy to add and train new parameters to pre-trained transformer-based language models.</p>
