I am a 3rd year PhD student working on Natural Language Processing. 

I am interested in modular transfer learning where I currently find [Adapters](https://AdapterHub.ml) quite cool to work with. 
My focus is on multilingual and multimodal transfer, where I am especially interested in very low resource languages.

I am one of the main contributors of the [AdapterHub.ml](https://AdapterHub.ml) framework, which makes it very easy to add and train new parameters to pre-trained transformer-based language models.
